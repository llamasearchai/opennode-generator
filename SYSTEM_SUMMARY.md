# OpenNode System Summary

## System Overview

OpenNode is an advanced AI-driven npm package generator that creates production-ready packages from textual descriptions. It integrates multiple OpenAI models (GPT-4o, o1-preview, o3-mini) to provide intelligent code generation with comprehensive testing, documentation, and deployment capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Core Engine

- Location: src/core/index.ts
- Purpose: Manages the primary package generation pipeline with OpenAI integration.
- Key Features:
  - Configurable AI model selection
  - Package structure generation
  - Automated code, test, and documentation creation

### 2. Interactive CLI

- Location: src/cli/ui.ts
- Purpose: Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for package creation and system interaction.
- Key Features:
  - Interactive menu system
  - Detailed configuration options
  - Real-time progress feedback

### 3. UltraThink Engine

- Location: src/ultrathink/index.ts
- Purpose: Implements advanced AI reasoning capabilities for complex package requirements.
- Key Features:
  - Multi-model collaboration
  - Self-improving code generation
  - Creative problem-solving strategies

### 4. Code Analyzer

- Location: src/analysis/index.ts
- Purpose: Analyzes code quality, security, and performance metrics for generated or existing packages.
- Key Features:
  - Comprehensive quality metrics
  - Security vulnerability assessment
  - Performance optimization recommendations

### 5. Template Manager

- Location: src/templates/index.ts
- Purpose: Manages pre-built package templates for various use cases.
- Key Features:
  - Multiple template types (CLI, React, Express, Utility)
  - Custom template support
  - Template categorization and search

### 6. FastAPI Backend

- Location: api/main.py
- Purpose: Provides a robust API for remote package generation and system integration.
- Key Features:
  - RESTful endpoints for package generation
  - WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Authentication and task management

## Testing Infrastructure

- Configuration: jest.config.js, test/setup.ts
- Test Suite: test/core.test.ts
- Coverage: Configured for 80% minimum across branches, functions, lines, and statements
- Categories: Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, quality assessments

## Deployment

- Docker Configuration: Dockerfile (Node.js), Dockerfile.api (FastAPI)
- Build Process: Multi-stage builds for optimized image size and security
- Environment: Configurable via environment variables for API keys and settings

## Dependencies

- Node.js: Primary runtime for CLI and core functionality
- OpenAI SDK: Integration with AI models for code generation
- FastAPI/Uvicorn: Backend service for API access
- Jest: Testing framework for validation
- TypeScript: Language for type-safe development

## System Requirements
